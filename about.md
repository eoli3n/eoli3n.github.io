I'm a DevOps linux sysadmin who works at a French university.
Arch Linux user since 2014 and Void Linux since 2020.
I automate, document, version because I'm lazy! Let the work be done a single time...
I'm not a dev, that's why I like python and don't dislike JS.
Minimalist with just a grain of comfort salt, I use opensource because of the Wisdom of Crowds, and because behind each computer is a human, behind each human, an idea.

Keep It Simple, Stupid ! to be able to maintain it with minimum effort and maximum efficiency.
If I can do something which will benefit others, I like to help, to teach, to share.

Climbing is cool, but not as much as making bread, pizza or cheese.

This blog runs with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), powered by [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).
I wrote my theme from [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template.
