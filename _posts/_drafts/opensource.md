Computing is about code executed by a CPU, that's all.


When a developer write its code, he needs then to distribute it.
Distribute sources became even more easy with git. A lot of project are hosted on github or gitlab.

Here are benefits to open source.

### Security

When the code is readable by anyone, you can't hide malicious functions. Most of proprietary software now embeed [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry#Software).
One could argue that the open source can benefit to black hats too. After all, everything is about trust. I trust more a big community with some black hats, than 5 devs in a lambda company.
Note that more critical is the tool, and more user use it, more good eyes will catch issues and help to secure it. (openssh, openssl). In the other side, closing sources will not prevent black hats to try to break your tool.

Vulnerabilities are reported on [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/)

### Quality

In the same way, when your intentions are crystal clear, it opens some discussions, reconsiderations.

### Contributions

As I like to test new softwares and help to improve it, I always make [feature requests](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Aeoli3n+feature+request) and report issues. When I'm

### Community

Asking help on IRC is great, people are helpful

### Diversity



### Interoperability

Import/export is not interoperability.

### Licensing



### Conclusion

Open source is the only sane way.
